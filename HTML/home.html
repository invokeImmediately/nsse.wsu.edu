			<h2 class="tt--none">Student Responses to NSSE Make a Difference!</h2>
			<p class="article-tagline"><strong>Since 2000, WSU students have been invited to take the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), a survey centered around student engagement and the educational experiences available at WSU. NSSE results have helped WSU build living-learning communities that bridge classes and residence halls, broaden high-impact undergraduate research opportunities with mentoring faculty, and expand student services.</strong></p>
			<h3 class="tt--none">How It Works</h3>
			<p>On February 28,  senior and first-year students will receive an email with an invitation to take the NSSE survey that is sent by NSSE on behalf of President Schulz . Students can access the NSSE survey through a link in the email, from <a href="https://my.wsu.edu/">myWSU</a> , or from a WSU social media post about NSSE. Students who do not immediately participate in the survey will receive up to four weekly follow-up emails.</p>
			<h3 class="tt--none">Why NSSE is Important</h3>
			<p>NSSE provides data for WSU that can be analyzed for different campuses, colleges, schools, academic departments, and student affairs groups. Some NSSE data can even be compared to peer institutions, to provide insight into how WSU compares nationally. Results from the 2019 survey will be shared with WSU in late summer.</p>
			<p>See results from previous NSSE surveys on the <a href="https://ir.wsu.edu/nsse-survey/">WSU Institutional Research</a> website.</p>
			<h3>Ready to take NSSE?</h3>
			<p>Click through to <a href="https://my.wsu.edu/">myWSU</a> and look for the &#8220;NSSE&#8221; tile on your homepage.</p>

			<h3>How can I access NSSE?</h3>
			<p>Starting on February 28, NSSE will be distributed via email to senior and first-year students, with a unique link for each student. Once the survey is complete, no more emails will be sent. Students may also access the survey through <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a>, or through direct links from WSU social media accounts.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://email.wsu.edu/">WSU Email</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://my.wsu.edu/">myWSU</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How long will NSSE take to complete?</h3>
			<p>NSSE is a comprehensive survey, and will ask you to reflect on your experiences at WSU. The average response takes 15-20 minutes.</p>
			<p>If you&#8217;re unable to complete the survey in one session, NSSE will save your progress for later.</p>
			<h3>How do I know that the email I received about NSSE is valid?</h3>
			<p>We understand your concern! WSU partners with Indiana University for the administration of NSSE. Each eligible WSU senior or first-year student will receive an email with a unique link to take the survey at <a href="https://nssesurvey.org/login.cfm">http://nssesurvey.org</a>. These emails are sent by NSSE on behalf of President Schulz.</p>
			<p>If you have doubts about your NSSE email, simply log in to <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a> and look for the NSSE tile on your homepage.</p>
			<h3>What if I don&#8217;t want to participate?</h3>
			<p>If you do not wish to participate in NSSE, click through to the survey and select &#8220;opt out.&#8221; You will no longer receive NSSE emails.</p>

			<h3>When can I take the NSSE survey?</h3>
			<p>NSSE opens on February 28. Look for an email invitation in your WSU email, log on to <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a>, or click through from select social media promotions.</p>

			<h3>What do I get if I participate?</h3>
			<p>In appreciation for participating, each student who completes the survey by April 15 will be entered into a drawing for one of seventeen $100 Visa gift cards. Your chances of winning depend on the number of students that complete the survey on your campus. These odds of winning are approximate based on participation in prior years.</p>
