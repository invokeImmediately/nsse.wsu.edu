			<h2>Student Responses to NSSE Make a Difference!</h2>
			<p class="article-tagline"><strong>Since 2000, WSU students have been invited to take the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), a survey centered around student engagement and the educational experiences available at WSU.</strong> NSSE results have helped WSU expand student services, build living-learning communities that bridge classes and residence halls, and broaden undergraduate research opportunities with mentoring faculty.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="" class="column one ">
			<h3 class="fs--h4">How It Works: March 2021</h3>
			<p>On March 1,  senior and first-year students will receive an email with an invitation to take the NSSE survey that is sent by NSSE on behalf of WSU President Kirk Schulz . Students can access the NSSE survey through a link in the email, from <a href="https://my.wsu.edu/">myWSU</a> , or from a WSU social media post about NSSE. Students who do not immediately participate in the survey will receive up to four weekly follow-up emails.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="" class="column two ">
			<h3 class="fs--h4">Why NSSE is Important</h3>
			<p>NSSE provides data for WSU that can be analyzed for different campuses, colleges, schools, academic departments, and student affairs groups. Some NSSE data can be compared to peer institutions to provide insight into how WSU compares nationally. See results from the latest survey (2019) as well as from previous years on the <a href="https://ir.wsu.edu/nsse-survey/">WSU Institutional Research</a> website.</p>

		<div style="" class="column one ">
			<h3 class="fs--h1 tt--uppercase">Ready to take NSSE?</h3>
			<p><a href="https://my.wsu.edu/">You can take the NSSE through myWSU</a>. Look for the &#8220;NSSE&#8221; tile on your homepage.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2 class="gray-darker-text">Additional Information about NSSE</h2>

	<section id="builder-section-1548440491707" class="row halves gutter pad-top">
		<div style="" class="column one ">
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">How can I access NSSE?</h3>
			<p>Starting on March 1, NSSE will be distributed via email to senior and first-year students, with a unique link for each student. Once the survey is complete, no more emails will be sent. Students may also access the survey through <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a>, or through direct links from WSU social media accounts.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://email.wsu.edu/">WSU Email</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://my.wsu.edu/">myWSU</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">How long will NSSE take to complete?</h3>
			<p>NSSE is a comprehensive survey asking you to reflect on your experiences at WSU. The average response takes 15-20 minutes.</p>
			<p>If you&#8217;re unable to complete the survey in one session, NSSE will save your progress for later.</p>
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">How do I know that the email I received about NSSE is valid?</h3>
			<p>We understand your concern! Here is how you can be confident that you are taken the actual NSSE survey. First, please note that WSU partners with Indiana University for the administration of NSSE. Consequently, the NSSE survey is hosted on a website that is outside of the WSU web domain. Each eligible WSU senior or first-year student will receive an email with a unique link to take the survey at <a href="https://nssesurvey.org/login.cfm">http://nssesurvey.org</a>. These emails are sent by NSSE on behalf of President Schulz.</p>
			<p>If you have doubts about your NSSE email, simply log in to <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a> and look for the NSSE tile on your homepage.</p>
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">What if I don&#8217;t want to participate?</h3>
			<p>If you do not wish to participate in NSSE, click through to the survey and select &#8220;opt out.&#8221; You will no longer receive NSSE emails.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="" class="column two ">
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">When can I take the NSSE survey?</h3>
			<p>NSSE opens on March 1. Look for an email invitation in your WSU email, log on to <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a>, or click through from select social media promotions.</p>
			<p>Email invitations for NSSE will be sent on the following dates. Once your survey is complete, no more emails will be sent to you.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>March 1</li>
				<li>March 9</li>
				<li>March 15</li>
				<li>March 23</li>
				<li>March 29</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">What do I get if I participate?</h3>
			<p>In appreciation for participating, each student who completes the survey by April 15 will be entered into a drawing for one of 18 $100 Visa gift cards. Your chances of winning depend on the number of students that complete the survey on your campus. Based on campus participation in 2019, your odds of winning are approximately:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pullman, 10 winners (1 in 180)</li>
				<li>Vancouver, 2 winners (1 in 185)</li>
				<li>Tri-Cities, 1 winner (1 in 160)</li>
				<li>Spokane, 2 winners (1 in 39)</li>
				<li>Global Campus, 2 winners (1 in 75)</li>
				<li>Everett, 1 winner (1 in 25)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="fs--h4 gray-darker-text">Am I eligible to take NSSE?</h3>
			<p>NSSE is administered to senior and first-year students on all WSU campuses. Eligible students will be able to access NSSE through WSU email or <a href="https://my.wsu.edu">myWSU</a> starting March 1.</p>
